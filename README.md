# Downloading Github Gists

This Rust application provides functionality for downloading GitHub Gists through a command-line interface. It allows users to either list gists for a specified GitHub username or download them to a local folder. 
The main functionality is split into two commands: 

- "list": displays gists for a given user with an optional limit on the number of gists to show, 
- "download": fetches gists to a local directory with configurable concurrency. 

## Usage

- List gists for a user

```bash
local_gist list --username <username> --limit 10
```

- Download gists

```bash
local_gist download --username <username> --limit 10 --concurrency 10
```

The download command uses a semaphore to control concurrent downloads, using O(n) memory for tracking the gists are are going to be downloaded. Could implement streaming downloads to disk during pagination to reduce memory usage. All operations are handled asynchronously.

## Dependencies

The application uses the clap crate for command-line argument parsing, tokio for asynchronous operations, and tracing for logging, while handling errors with anyhow and thiserror. Probably should be using only one of those.

```toml
anyhow = { version = "1.0" }
clap = { version = "4.5.30", features = ["derive"] }
reqwest = { version = "0.12.12", features = ["json", "native-tls-vendored"] }
serde = { version = "1.0.217", features = ["derive"] }
serde_json = { version = "1.0.138" }
tokio = { version = "1.43.0", features = ["full"] }
tracing = { version = "0.1.41" }
tracing-subscriber = { version = "0.3.19" }
thiserror = { version = "2.0.11" }
```
